## Wordle Program
I recreated  <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a> using the program Replit, Java, and a list of 10,000 words. My program first makes a new string array using only 5 letter words from the list of words. It then chooses one of those words randomly, and makes a 12x5 2d array. It asks for guesses, and returns a '@' if the letter is in the word, but in the wrong spot, a '*' if the letter is in the right spot, or an 'x' if the letter isn't in the word.
